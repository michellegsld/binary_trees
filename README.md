## WHAT ARE BINARY TREES?

A binary tree is a type of data structure. Its main purpose is to store data. What makes a binary tree a unique data structure is that each node can have a maximum of two children. Binary trees can be implemented using the help of arrays or of linked lists/ nodes. Most data structures are abstract concepts and hard to visualize. Below, we will break down some essentials of binary trees and hopefully clarify any questions.

### COMPONENTS
#### ROOT - the top-most node in the tree, starting node
#### PATH - the nodes at the edge of the tree
#### PARENT - a node who has children and isn't the root
#### CHILD - a node who has a parent pointer
#### LEAVES - the nodes found at the bottom most level, no children
#### SUBTREE - descendents of a node
#### LEVEL - representation of a nodes generation, root node will be at level zero
#### TRAVERSING - moving through the nodes, trees
