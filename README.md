A binary tree is a type of data structure. Its main purpose is to store data. What makes a binary tree a unique data structure is that each node can have a maximum of two children. Binary trees can be implemented using the help of arrays or of linked lists/ nodes. Most data structures are abstract concepts and hard to visualize.
